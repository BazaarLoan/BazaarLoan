Lessons Learned:
- OpenBazaar is an Decentralized Marketplace
- Creates a socket via random port.
	var getRandomPort = function() {
	var port = Math.floor((Math.random() * 10000) + 30000);
- JavaScript can be used outside of XSS and reverse-shell uploads
- Google Chrome Deveoloper Tool
	- Inspect elements
	- View Client-Server Errors
	- View Params for HTTP Requests (Similar to Burp Suite)
- Unicode Strings received from python library requests
- truffle is a nice management and compiling system for Ethereum
- Download bitcoin.git to create addresses is the easiest way to get public addresses.
- Ethereum breaks a lot. (Tried across 2 OS, both had dependencies and docuemtnation areas that broke)
